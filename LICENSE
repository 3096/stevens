    . . . You can tell the guy on xentax that if he wants to, he can republish my program as his own. He can even put
    his name on it hahaha that's why I made it open source so that the new guys could take over. Wouldn't offend me
    at all. Really nice what that one guy did with the DW games and now with the RE series. I'm happy at least
    someone can figure out all that crap code I wrote years ago! Consider the program and code public domain.
